% Vet and Merge Trainings
% This code allows you to select all the downloaded .mat files from the
% class and run a few different operations on it. After selecting all the
% files, a window will pop up (perhaps very small in the upper left corner 
% of your screen) asking if you'd like to review the files. If
% you select yes, this will draw small plots of each individual training
% for every file. If a file has 100 trainings in it, then the figure will
% show 100 small plots. The main purpose of this is to vet the trainings
% and see if there are any obvious bad trainings that you'd like to
% exclude. If there's something you don't like, the filename is listed at
% the top of the figure to facilitate finding and deleting the file.

% After reviewing the files, the next option will be to perform a size
% check on each of the trainings. If there are inproperly sized trainings
% (too many or too few samples) it will be flagged and reported.

% After checking the training sizes, there will be another window pop up
% asking if you'd like the merge the files. If you reviewed files and and
% found that you don't want all of them included, select 'no' and come back
% later after you've re-run this script selecting the proper files. If
% you're confident in the files, you can skip the 'review' step, as it
% takes a minute to load all the plots.

% Finally, the code will prompt the user for a filename to save the data.
