% ECE 3610
% INTEL LAB 4 -- Intro to Convolutional Neural Networks & Network
% Architecture
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The goal of this lab is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
% detect numbers gestured with an accelerometer. One advantage of a CNN 
% over LDA or perceptron classification is that the CNN will decide what
% the "best" features are for us (in the case of perceptron classification 
% or LDA, we had to tell them what features to analyze).  Typically, the
% computer can find better features than we are able to do visually, etc.
% 
% At a minimum you need to be able to reliably distinguish between ZERO, 
% ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, and NINE with at least 
% 73% accuracy. You will be responsible for modifying the neural network 
% architecture to achieve this goal.

%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE or port_detector.m. Note that the
%  clc and clear all will clear your command window and all saved
%  variables!

clear; clc; close all; %initialization

% for PC:
nb = nanobot('COM10', 115200, 'serial');
% for Mac:
%nb = nanobot('/dev/cu.usbmodem14301', 115200, 'serial');

nb.ledWrite(0);  % make sure the LED is off

%% 2. Specify initial parameters:
% Since the CNN is going to choose features for us, it helps to have more
% data to work with.  Hence, we are increasing the trialCount from the last
% lab.
trialCount = 12; % Specify how many times you will gesture each digit.
                 % This needs to be fairly large because we will be
                 % splitting up the data into training and testing data.
                 % Must be divisible by 4 because 3/4 will be used for
                 % training and 1/4 will be used for testing.
if (mod(trialCount,4) ~= 0) % check that trialCount is divisible by 4.
    error("trialCount must be divisible by 4");
end
digits = 0:9; % specify which digits you will be gesturing
numreads = 150; % about 2 seconds (on serial)
if (numreads ~= 150) % check that numreads is equal to 150
    error("numreads must be equal to 150 in this lab so we can take"+ ...
        " advatange of crowdsourcing later");
end
vals = zeros(3,numreads);

%% Collect Multiple Gestures
% For all of these intel labs, you can hold the dowel however you want.  
% However, you should try to be consistent in how you hold it from one lab 
% to the next.

digitCount = length(digits); % determine the number of digits
data = cell(digitCount, trialCount+1); % preallocate cell array
for i = 1:digitCount
    data{i,1} = digits(i);
end

clc; % clear command line

for a = 1:digitCount % iterate through all the digits
    
    fprintf(['Press return when you are ready to gesture ' ...
        'the %d''s\n'], digits(a));
    pause; % wait for a return from the user
    %display a countdown to prep user to move accelerometer 
    countdown("Beginning in", 3); 
    
    b = 1; %index for trials
    while b <= trialCount % iterate through all the trials
        % Displays the prompt in the command window
        fprintf("Draw a %d (%d of %d)",digits(a), b, trialCount); 
        % Turn on the LED to signify the start of recording data
        nb.ledWrite(1);                

        % Gesture is performed during the segement below
        for i = 1:numreads
            val = nb.accelRead();
            vals(1,i) = val.x;
            vals(2,i) = val.y;
            vals(3,i) = val.z;
        end

        nb.ledWrite(0);  %Turn off the LED to signify end of recording data 
        try
            % put the 3-axis (x,y,z) accel data of length numreads into 
            % the cell array at location a,b+1 (b=1 is reserved for 
            % recording which digit it is)
            data{a,b+1} = [vals(1,:);vals(2,:);vals(3,:)]; 
            b = b + 1;
        catch
            disp("Data capture failed. Trying again in 3 seconds")
            pause(3);
        end

    end
end

pause(1); % wait one second
clc; % clear command line

% Save your data to a file so that you can reload it and reuse it 
% later if desired.  The file will probably be saved in the current folder.
if menu("Would you like to save the dataset you just recorded?", ...
        "Yes", "No") == 1

    save(filename, "data");
end

%% 3. (OPTIONAL, AS NEEDED) 
% Once you have a good set of training data for this lab, as needed you 
% can reload that data from the corresponding file here.  MATLAB will look 
% in the current directory for the file.
clear; clc; close all; %initialization
filename = "2026318_13281_TrainingSet_10Digits12Trials.mat";  % add the directory before the filename

data = importdata(filename);

%% 4. Store Data as "Images" for Neural Network
%determine digitCount and trialCount based on data size
digitCount = height(data); %number of digits is the number of rows (height)
trialCount = width(data)-1; %number of trials is the number of columns (width)
%features are stored as a stack of 3D images (4D array), initialize to zero
TrainingFeatures = zeros(3,150,1,digitCount*trialCount); 
%labels are stored as a 1D array, initialize to zero
labels = zeros(1,digitCount*trialCount); 

k=1; %simple counter
for a = 1:digitCount %iterate through digits
    for b = 1:trialCount %iterate through trials
        % For a CNN, the input is no longer features we define, but the 
        % data itself.  The CNN determines the features.
        TrainingFeatures(:,:,:,k) = data{a,b+1}; %put data into image stack
        labels(k) = data{a,1}; %put each label into label stack
        k = k + 1; %increment
    end
end
labels = categorical(labels); %convert labels into categorical

%% 5. Split Training and Testing Data
%selection is an array that will hold the value of 1 when that data is 
%selected to be training data and a 0 when that data is selected to be 
%testing data
selection = ones(1,digitCount*trialCount); %allocate logical array
                                             %initialize all to 1 at first
selectionIndices = []; %initialization
for b = 1:digitCount %pick 1/4 of the data for testing
    selectionIndices = [selectionIndices,  ...
        round(linspace(1,trialCount,round(trialCount/4))) + ...
        (trialCount*(b-1))];
end
selection(selectionIndices) = 0; %set logical to zero to indicate testing 
                                 %data

%training data
xTrain = TrainingFeatures(:,:,:,logical(selection)); %get subset (3/4) of features to train on
yTrain = labels(logical(selection)); %get subset (3/4) of labels to train on
%testing data
xTest = TrainingFeatures(:,:,:,~logical(selection)); % get subset (1/4) of features to test on
yTest = labels(~logical(selection)); %get subset (1/4) of labels to test on

%% 7. Train Neural Network
% Check the validation accuracy here or go to the next section and check 
% that both the accuracy and the confusion matrix together are good enough 
% before going on.  

% A note about the number of epochs in the plot vs. the number of 
% iterations.  First:
%     Epochs = number of times all of the training data passes through 
%              the network 
%     Iterations = number of times that both a mini-batch of data (i.e. 
%              mini-batch of "images") is passed through the network and 
%              the network parameters are updated
% MATLAB's default mini-batch size is 128 (i.e. there are 128 "images" in 
% each mini-batch). Also, since:
%     Iterations per epoch = (total number of training "images") / 
%                                  (number of "images" in each mini-batch)
% And, in this code:
%     Total number of training samples ("images") = trialCount * digitCount 
% Using the above, the calculated number of iterations per epoch turns out 
% to be < 1. Since we need to pass all of the data through the network at
% least once during each epoch, the number of iterations per epoch becomes 
% one (i.e. there is one iteration per epoch).  Check this in the plot that 
% is created.
