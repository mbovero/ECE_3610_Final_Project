% INTEL LAB 2 -- Intro to Machine Learning & Feature Generation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% We will use Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) to classify between 
% gesturing a zero or one. Similar to the last lab, we will need to 
% choose what is important in the data (i.e. choose the features, such as 
% range, max, min, etc.).  But this time, LDA will analyze those features 
% make the classification decision for us.

%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE or port_detector.m. Note that the
%  clc and clear all will clear your command window and all saved
%  variables!

clear; clc; close all; %initialization

% for PC:
nb = nanobot('COM10', 115200, 'serial');
% for Mac:
%nb = nanobot('/dev/cu.usbmodem14301', 115200, 'serial');

nb.ledWrite(0);  % make sure the LED is off

%% 2. Specify initial parameters:
trialCount = 6; % specify how many times you will gesture each digit
digits = [0, 1]; % specify which digits you will be gesturing
numreads = 150; % about 2 seconds (on serial); adjust as needed, but we 
                % will be using a value of 150 for Labs 4 and 5

%% 3. Collect Multiple Gestures

% For all of these intel labs, you can hold the dowel however you want.  
% However, you should try to be consistent in how you hold it from one lab 
% to the next.
digitCount = length(digits); % determine the number of gestures
data = cell(digitCount, trialCount+1); % preallocate cell array
for i = 1:digitCount
    data{i,1} = digits(i);  % create a cell matrix to store the results
                            % for each trialCount of each digit
end

clc; % clear the command line

for a = 1:digitCount % iterate through all the digits
    
    fprintf(['Press return when you are ready to gesture ' ...
        'the %d''s\n'], digits(a));
    pause; % wait for a return from the user
    %display a countdown to prep user to move accelerometer 
    countdown("Beginning in", 3); 
    
    b = 1; %index for trials
    while b <= trialCount % iterate through all the trials
        % Displays the prompt in the command window
        fprintf("Draw a %d (%d of %d)",digits(a), b, trialCount); 
        % Turn on the LED to signify the start of recording data
        nb.ledWrite(1); 

        % Gesture is performed during the segment below
        for i = 1:numreads
            val = nb.accelRead();
            vals(1,i) = val.x;
            vals(2,i) = val.y;
            vals(3,i) = val.z;
        end

        nb.ledWrite(0);  %Turn off the LED to signify end of recording data  
        try
            % put the 3-axis (x,y,z) accel data of length numreads into 
            % the cell array at location a,b+1 (b=1 is reserved for 
            % recording which digit it is)
            data{a,b+1} = [vals(1,:);vals(2,:);vals(3,:)]; 
            b = b + 1;
        catch
            disp("Data capture failed. Trying again in 3 seconds")
            pause(3);
        end
        clc; % clear the command line
        pause(1); % wait one second
    end
end

pause(1); % wait one second
clc; % clear command line

% Save your data to a file so that you can reload it and reuse it 
% later if desired.  The file will be saved in the current folder listed
% in the "Current Folder" panel of MATLAB.
if menu("Would you like to save the dataset you just recorded?", ...
        "Yes", "No") == 1
    % Add some parameters to the filename, so we know which is which
    t = clock;
    filename = sprintf("%d%d%d_%d%d%d_TrainingSet_%dDigits%dTrials", ...
        t(1),t(2),t(3),t(4),t(5),round(t(6)),height(data),width(data)-1);
    save(filename, "data");
end

%% 4. (OPTIONAL, AS NEEDED) 
% Once you have a good set of training data for this lab, as needed you 
% can reload that data from the corresponding file here.  MATLAB will look 
% in the current directory for the file.
clear; clc; close all; %initialization
filename = "b202632_134821_TrainingSet_2Digits6Trials.mat";  % add the directory before the filename 
                                 % if needed
data = importdata(filename);

%% 5. Calculate 3 features for each "image" 
% (One "image" is the 3-axis accelerometer data for one gesture.)
% Now we will define what features we want the LDA to use to classify the 
% digits. One of the features will be applied to the x-axis accelerometer 
% data, the second will be applied to the y-axis accelerometer data, and 
% the third will be applied to the z-axis data.

%determine the number of digits and trials based on data size
digitCount = height(data); %number of digits is the number of rows (height)
trialCount = width(data)-1; %number of trials is the number of columns (width)

% Create the matrix that will store the features of the data
Features = zeros(digitCount, trialCount, 3); % 3 because the accelerometer 
                                             % provides 3 axes of data

% Cycle through all of the gestures (trials for each digit). The 
% accelerometer data for each gesture is stored in "singleLetters" as 
% defined below.  For each "singleLetter", we need to define and calculate 
% the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis features to be used by the LDA. 
for a = 1:digitCount %iterate through all digits
    for b = 1:trialCount %iterate through all trials

        singleLetter = data{a,b+1}; % get the individual 3-axis 
                                    % accelerometer data for trial "b" of 
                                    % digit "a". The resulting singleletter
                                    % is of size [3,numreads]. 

        %%%%%%%%%% CALCULATE FEATURES (YOUR CODE GOES HERE) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

        % All of the gestures created a lot of data (100 x, y, and z accel
        % readings for each gesture).  We are going to reduce all of that 
        % data to a small number of features (three features) for each 
        % gesture, which is easier for the LDA to work with and analyze.
        %
        % The right side of each of the three lines below creates a random
        % number.  It is a placeholder so that the code will compile.  
        % You should replace the three random numbers with the feature
        % we want to extract from the x data, the y data, and the z data, 
        % respectively.
        %
        % HINTS: Ultimately, pick the features that will help you to best 
        % distinguish between the gestures.  Some options that you can test 
        % include: max, min, range, mean, square the data, variance, root 
        % mean square, how many times the data crosses zero, etc.  You can 
        % use the same type of feature for all three x,y,z components, or
        % you can use different features for the x,y,z components.          
        % Try at least 3 different features for comparison.  
        % Note that you can re-analyze the same gesture data you already 
        % obtained, so you do not need to rerun the earlier part of the 
        % code once you have a good dataset to work with.

        x = singleLetter(1,:);
        y = singleLetter(2,:);
        z = singleLetter(3,:);

        Features(a,b,1) = std(x); % Delete rand(1,1) and replace it with 
                                     % the feature you want to extract from
                                     % the x-axis data
        Features(a,b,2) = std(y); % feature for the y-axis data (GOOD)
        Features(a,b,3) = std(z); % feature for the z-axis data

% The features will be plotted in 3-D.  You can click on the "Rotate 3-D"

%% 8. Plot features & LDA
% The features and LDA are plotted in 3-D.  You can click on the 
% "Rotate 3-D" button on the top right side of the plot to view it from 
% different angles.  Rotate the plot until you can see the hyperplane that 
% separates the gesture features.  Ideally all of the features for zero are 
% on one side of the hyperplane and all of the features for one are on the 
% other side of the hyperplane.
figure(); hold on; grid on; % create plot
for a = 1:digitCount
    % plot x, y, z values from features 1, 2, and 3 respectively
