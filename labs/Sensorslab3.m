%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Tilt detection using an IMU (inertial measurement unit) is critical for a 
% huge number of products - the Wii-mote, quadrotors, and commercial 
% aircraft, to name a few. The three-axis MEMS accelerometer in your 
% Arduino is a critical component of the IMU. In this lab, we will find out 
% how the measurements from the IMU can be used to calculate and visualize 
% the tilt angle of the Arduino in real time.
% 
% Deliverables:
% - Fill in the correct orientation of the accelerometer axes at the end 
% of section 2.
% - Demonstrate the 3D tilt matching game. 
% - Fill in your answers to section 5 (impact of changing the pause).
% - Be able to discuss your results for section 6 (impact of changing 
% numReads, angle_threshold, pause).
%
% Extensions:
% - Change the color of the 3D box being displayed every time you press a
% pushbutton.
% - Change the color of the 3D box being displayed every time you tap 
% the accelerometer.

%% 2. Testing the onboard IMU in the presence of gravity
% For this part, position the Arduino flat to the horizon, the Arduino's 
% pins oriented downwards towards the floor, and the Arduino's microUSB 
% port oriented towards you.

% Your Arduino board has a built-in accelerometer that can be used to
% observe the effect of gravity as well as its own movement (i.e. the 
% acceleration of the Arduino in the x, y, and z directions).  If an 
% accelerometer is at rest on a surface, it will register acceleration 
% due to gravity (~9.8 m/s^2).

% Let's first examine the effect of gravity on the output of the IMU. Try 
% writing (single or averaged) accelerometer values to the screen and/or 
% creating a live plot.  What are the x, y, and z values when the board 
% is flat vs. other orientations?   
%
% HINT; 'accel' in nanobot_demo.m stands for accelerometer 

% FILL IN code here to create a live plot 
%%
% ACCEL READ

%Here is an example of taking a single accelerometer reading:
val = nb.accelRead();

%The axis values are saved as fields in a structure:
fprintf('x: %.2f, y: %.2f, z: %.2f\n', val.x, val.y, val.z);

%Here is an example of taking 10 accelerometer readings, then averaging
%each axis:
tic
while (toc<5)
    numreads = 10;
    vals = zeros(3,numreads);
    for i = 1:numreads
        val = nb.accelRead();
        vals(1,i) = val.x;
        vals(2,i) = val.y;
        vals(3,i) = val.z;
    end
    %Note the index, getting every column in a specific row for each axis:
    meanx = mean(vals(1,:));
    meany = mean(vals(2,:));
    meanz = mean(vals(3,:));
    fprintf('mean x: %.2f, mean y: %.2f, mean z: %.2f\n', meanx, meany, meanz);
end



% FILL IN code to take a (single or averaged) reading and writing the 
% value to the screen.






% What is the accelerometer's approximate x value when the chip is flat to 
% the horizon? (record the closest integer value, i.e. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 
% etc.)
x_flat = -0.01;
% What is the accelerometer's approximate y value when the chip is flat to 
% the horizon? (record the closest integer value, i.e. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 
% etc.)
y_flat = -0.02;
% What is the accelerometer's approximate z value when the chip is flat to 
% the horizon? (record the closest integer value, i.e. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 
% etc.)
z_flat = 1;

% What are the accelerometer's values when the chip is on its left side?
x_left_side = 0;
y_left_side = 1;
z_left_side = 0;

% What are the accelerometer's values when the chip is on its right side?
x_right_side = 0;
y_right_side = -1;
z_right_side = 0;

% What are the accelerometer's values when the microUSB is oriented 
% straight upwards?
x_microUSB_up = 1;
y_microUSB_up = 0;
z_microUSB_up = 0;

% What are the accelerometer's values when the microUSB is oriented 
% straight downwards?
x_microUSB_dwn = -1;
y_microUSB_dwn = 0;
z_microUSB_dwn = 0;

% Position the Arduino flat to the horizon again and with its microUSB port 
% oriented towards you.
% Using your results obtained earlier in this section, the x, y, and z-axes 
% of the accelerometer on board the Arduino are oriented:  (1) vertically 
% up/down; (2) left/right; (3) front/back (in line with the microUSB port).  
% Fill in the blanks below.  
x_axis_orientation = "front/back"; %keep the quotes to keep this a string
y_axis_orientation = "left/right"; %keep the quotes to keep this a string
z_axis_orientation = "up/down"; %keep the quotes to keep this a string

%% 3. Visualizing IMU tilt
% Next, let's move the Arduino and use gravity and the accelerometer values 
% to visualize the movement of the Arduino (roll and pitch) in a plot 
% created by MATLAB.

% First, this section of code will set up a 3D box that will represent 
% the Arduino in the plot. This section will not create a plot yet.  Just 
% run it to set the features of the 3D box (i.e. the dimensions, colors,
% and corner locations of each side of the box.

% Initialize the cube 
xc=0; yc=0; zc=0;    % cube center coordinates
L=2;                 % cube size (length of an edge)
alpha=0.8;           % transparency (max=1=opaque)

% define the X, Y, and Z coordinates of each corner of the box; use to 
% plot each face of the box
X = [0 0 0 0 1 0; 0 1 0 0 1 1; 0 1 1 1 1 1; 0 0 1 1 1 0];
Y = [0 0 0 0 0 1; 1 0 1 1 1 1; 1 0 1 1 1 1; 0 0 0 0 0 1];
Z = [0 0 1 0 0 0; 0 0 1 0 0 0; 1 1 1 0 1 1; 1 1 1 0 1 1];

C= [0.1 0.5 0.9 0.9 0.1 0.5];   % each face of the box will have a 
                                % different color

X = L/1.5.*(X-0.5) + xc; %define the board length in the X-direction
Y = L*(Y-0.5) + yc;  %this is the long dimension of the board
Z = L/3*(Z-0.5) + zc; %this is the smallest dimension of the board
V=[reshape(X,1,24); reshape(Y,1,24); reshape(Z,1,24)]; %reshape takes all 
% of the elements of the 3D X matrix (and Y and Z matrices) and puts them 
% all into one column of dimension [1,24].  So, the first dimension of V 
% holds all of the X elements, the second dimension of V holds all of the 
% Y elements, and the third dimension of V holds all of the Z elements.

%% 4. Track IMU pose (track and plot the roll and pitch of the board)
% For this part, start with the Arduino flat to the horizon and with its 
% microUSB port oriented towards you.

% Today, we will only calculate the pitch and roll of the Arduino  
% because the Arduino Nano 33 IoT does not include a magnetometer.  
% Without a magnetometer, determining the yaw is more involved because 
% it requires an integration of the angular velocity (obtained from the 
% IMU's gyroscope) over time.  This can be left to a future exercise.  

% In this section, once you figure out all of the '?' parts, the 3D block 
% you defined in the last section will be plotted and should replicate the 
% roll and pitch movements of your board. In addition, a game has 
% been set up in which you will be given an orientation and you have to 
% try to match it (this type of programming is used inside of drones!).  
% When playing the game, make sure to uncomment the two game-related parts 
% of the code.

% Note:  If you get an error when trying to run "angle2dcm," then you
% need to install the Aerospace Toolbox (available for free through the 
% University Matlab license).

% Offset Calibration:
fprintf('Check the following and then press enter once:\n');
fprintf('1. The Arduino is lying flat (IMU chip parallel to horizon); and\n');
calib1 = input('2. The Arduino''s microUSB port is oriented towards you.');
% Now calibrate
% Here is an example of taking 10 accelerometer readings, then averaging
% each axis:
numreads = 10;
vals = zeros(3,numreads);
for i = 1:numreads
    val = nb.accelRead();
    vals(1,i) = val.x;
    vals(2,i) = val.y;
    vals(3,i) = val.z;
end
% find the mean of each of the x,y,z accelerometer values
meanOffx = mean(vals(1,:)); 
meanOffy = mean(vals(2,:));
meanOffz = mean(vals(3,:));
% As we tilt the board, we want to know the change in position relative 
% to it being flat (use your results from Part 2 of this lab to fill in the 
% blanks below):
xOff = meanOffx - x_flat; % Fill in the variable name for the x value when 
                         % the chip is flat
yOff = meanOffy - y_flat; % Fill in the variable name for the y value when 
                         % the chip is flat
zOff = meanOffz - z_flat; % Fill in the variable name for the z value when 
                       % the chip is flat

%% 5. Impact of the pause

% what happens and why.
  shorter_pause = ("The movement in the 3D plot is much smoother because we are sampling/computing more often.");  %keep the quotes to keep this a string

% Then try changing the pause to 0.5
  even_longer_pause = ("The movement in the 3D plot stutters even more because we are sampling/computing only twice per second.");  %keep the quotes to keep this a string

%% 6. Impact of numReads and angle_threshold
% The default numReads was 3, the default pause was 0.1 seconds, and the 
% default angle_threshold was 10 degrees.  Try increasing / decreasing 
% these values to determine the impact (e.g. Reduce the pause and increase 
% numReads. Can you decrease angle_threshold?)

% Upping numReads cause the 3D graph to be very laggy. I think this is
% because we are sampling the IMU many more times each cycle, which creates
% a delay.

% Yes, I changed angle_threshold to 5 degrees. It made the matching game a
% bit more challenging.
