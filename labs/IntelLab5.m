% Today we will crowd source data from everyone in the class and
% augment it to classify all 10 digits with near perfect accuracy 
% (>90% at least).

clear; clc; close all; %initialization

%% 1. Load in Merged Training Sets
% When you run this section, it will ask you to select the file you want to
% load.  A file has been prepared for you that combines all of the data
% from everyone in the class.

[file, path] = uigetfile('10DigitsTrainingSet_MergedData.mat');
load(fullfile(path,file));

% Figure out how many gestures there are.
[h, w] = size(data);
digitCount = h;
trialCount = w-1;
digits = [data{:,1}];

%% Data Augmentation
% NOTE:  Uncomment this part only after you have run through the code 
% at least once using today's larger data set.  Use this section to add 
% even more data and further imporve the results. 

% Instead of collecting even more gestures from even more people to 
% improve the accuracy of the classifications, we will create new 
% versions of the data that we already have.  We will add these to the 
% original set of data to create an even larger set of data for training 
% the CNN.

% NOTE!!! Once you uncomment this part of the code, the data set will
% be much larger, and thus the training will take much longer. Therefore,
% parameter you should change when including this section is maxEpoch.  
% You will probably want to set it equal to a value of 10 or less.
%
% Augmenting the data in this manner is especially useful whenever it's 
% not easy to collect more data.

%% 2. Store Data for Neural Network

%labels are stored as a 1D array, initialize to zero
labels = zeros(1,digitCount*trialCount);

for a = 1:digitCount %iterate through digits

    end
end

%% 3. Split Training and Testing Data
%selection is an array that will hold the value of 1 when that data is 
%selected to be training data and a 0 when that data is selected to be 
%testing data

%% 4. Define Neural Network

%% 5. Train Neural Network
% Check the accuracy here or go to the next section and check that both the 
% accuracy and the confusion matrix together are good enough before going 
% on. 

% A note about how long it takes to train your CNN in this lab:
% If maxEpoch is too small, the CNN won't be trained very well and the
% results will be poor.  Howwever, if maxEpoch is too large, the number of 
% iterations will be very large and the CNN will take a very long time to 
% train since you are working with more data this time, and the default 
% mini-batch size is 128.  If you find that the total number of iterations 
% is too large, you can decrease the number of epochs or you can set the 
% mini-batch size to something other than 128.
% From last time:
%     Epochs = number of times all of the training data passes through 
%              the network 
%     Iterations = number of times that both a mini-batch of data (i.e. 
%              mini-batch of "images") is passed through the network and 
%              the network parameters are updated
% MATLAB's default mini-batch size is 128 (i.e. there are 128 "images" in 
% each mini-batch). Also, since:
%     Iterations per epoch = (total number of training "images") / 
%                                  (number of "images" in each mini-batch)
% And, in this code:
%     Total number of training samples ("images") = trialCount * digitCount 
% Using the above, calculate the number of iterations per epoch, and check
% the total number of iterations:
%      Total Number of iterations = maxEpoch * Iterations per epoch
