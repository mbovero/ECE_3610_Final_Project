% Feedback between sensor inputs and actuator outputs is at the core of a
% huge number of robotic and cyberphysical system applications. In this
% lab, we will explore two different methods of sensorimotor feedback with
% naive control implementations. We will build on some of the underlying
% skills later, but for now we will largely be able to use code and
% concepts from earlier labs.
%
% Deliverables:
%   - An IMU tilt sensor that controls the speed of a DC motor
%   rotation, and reverses direction depending on tilt direction
%   - A flex sensor that sets the angle of a servo motor to match the
%   bend angle.
%
% Extensions:
%   - Use the IMU tilt sensor to control the speed of the DC motor using
%   one axis, and change the angle of the servo motor using the other.
%   (Speed and steering control!)

%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE. Note that the
%  clc and clear all will clear your command window and all saved
%  variables!

% for Mac:

%% 2. DC motor speed based on IMU Tilt
%  Using readings from your onboard IMU, control the speed and direction of 
%  your DC motor based on the tilt angle of the board.  Specifically, 
%  write your code so that the motor:
%  - Stops when the board is in its starting position (perhaps horizontal)
%  - Reaches a specified max speed when the board is fully tilted in one 
%    direction you choose
%  - Reaches the same max speed but running in the opposite direction when 
%    the board is fully tileted in the direction opposite to the one you 
%    chose above. 

%  To do this, first connect your motor to one of the motor ports (pair of 
%  motor pins) on your motor carrier using the screw-down connectors (such 
%  as M1- and M1+;  unscrew each connector first, insert the wire from the 
%  side, screw it closed again, and make sure the wire is being held 
%  securely by the screw).  Take note of which motor pins you are using.

%  ** IMPORTANT! **  Don't forget to plug in the motor carrier battery and 
%  turn the motor battery switch to ON.

    %Here is an example of taking 5 accelerometer readings, then averaging
    %each axis:
    numreads = 5;
    vals = zeros(3,numreads);
    for i = 1:numreads
        val = nb.accelRead();
        vals(1,i) = val.x;
        vals(2,i) = val.y;
        vals(3,i) = val.z;
    end
    %Note the index, getting every column in a specific row for each axis:
    meanx = mean(vals(1,:));
    meany = mean(vals(2,:));
    meanz = mean(vals(3,:));

    % DC motor based on the tilt angle of the board).  Try completing this
    % on your own first.  Then as desired, look at the hints below.

    % number of lines):

    nb.setMotor(1, meanx*25);

    % x_abs = abs(meanx);
    % mtr_speed = round(((x_abs - x_min)/(x_max - x_min))*(mtr_max - mtr_min) + mtr_min);
    % 
    % fprintf("acc_x mean: %d\n", meanx);
    % fprintf("motor speed: %d\n", mtr_speed);
    % 
    % 
    % % Micro USB port downward, spin clock wise
    % if (meanx < 0)
    %     nb.setMotor(1, mtr_speed);
    % % Micro USB port upward, spin counter clock wise
    % elseif (meanx > 0)
    %     nb.setMotor(1, -1*mtr_speed);
    % else    % IMU is level, stop motor
    %     nb.setMotor(1, 0);
    %     continue
    % end


    
    





    % HINT #1: It is probably useful to restrict your expected motor speed 
    % range. +/-100% duty cycle can be a bit aggressive on the motor and 
    % will drain your battery quickly.  So specify a max speed that is
    % <100%.
    % HINT #2:  You probably want to add a pause, since you don't need
    % to update the speed super often (too often).
    % HINT #3:  You can choose the tilt direction that you want to have 
    % control the speed of the motor.  For simplicity, you can choose just
    % one axis.
    % HINT #4: You can write some values to the screen so that you know the  
    % range of values you can expect from your inertial measurement 
    % unit (IMU) (you last used it in the Sensor 3 module). 
    % HINT #5:  Also think about the setMotor()'s accepted PWM values (you 
    % can look at setMotor() in nanobot_demo.m).
    % HINT #6: If the motor doesn't turn when instructed to do so, check
    % the LiPo battery level.  You can also try pushing the reset button on
    % the top of the Arduino.

%% 3. Servo angle matching flex sensor
% For this section, we will try to match the bend angle of our flex sensor
% with our servo's wiper. Keep in mind, the resistance of the flex sensor 
% is likely to only change significantly between 0 and 90 degrees.  
% Remember the flex sensor is only designed to be flexed in one direction -
% away from the ink.  bending the sensor in the other direction will not
% produce reliable data and may damage the sensor.  Also, take care not to
% bend the sensor at its base, as they have a tendency to kink and fail.
% Instead, bend the middle portion of the flex sensor.
% 
% Hook up your servo to one of the servo ports (with the brown wire aligned
% to ground, which corresponds to the white stripe on the underside of the 
% board), and set up a voltage divider with your flex sensor and 10k 
% resistor. Connect it to one of your analog read pins, and use the value 
% to determine the corresponding flex sensor and set the servo angles.

    % and min values you just found:
